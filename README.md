# StackViews-and-AutoLayout

In this Xcode project it's shown how to play with UIStackViews.
Everything is made programmatically.

This layout works in both Portrait and Landscape mode, with some changes in order to better fit the frame.

Portrait:
- The first stack is verical

Landscape:
- The first stack is horizontal

The first stack is the only component with autoLayout properties.
